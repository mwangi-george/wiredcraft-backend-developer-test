# wiredcraft-backend-developer-test
A repository hosting my response project to the Wiredcraft backend developer test

## Context
The ask was to build a RESTful API that can get/create/update/delete user data from a persistence database using the following user model

### User Model
```
{
  "id": "xxx",                  // user ID 
  "name": "test",               // user name
  "dob": "",                    // date of birth
  "address": "",                // user address
  "description": "",            // user description
  "createdAt": ""               // user created date
}
```
